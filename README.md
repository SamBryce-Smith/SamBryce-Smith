### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final year bioinformatics PhD student in the labs of Prof Pietro Fratta & Dr Maria Secrier at UCL. I mainly focus on bioinformatic analysis of alternative polyadenylation with RNA-seq data, especially bulk short-read RNA-seq and Nanopore long-read sequencing. Generally very interested in using sequencing approaches to understand how RNA-binding proteins influence the transcriptome and taking any opportunity to build :snake:make pipelines!

Currently working on:
- Novel methods for identifying, quantifying and assessing differential usage of polyA sites from bulk RNA-seq data (watch this space!).
- **[APAeval](https://github.com/iRNA-COSI/APAeval)** - a community project to develop a framework for reproducible benchmarking of bioinformatic algorithms and assess the performance of tools that identify and/or quantify polyA sites from bulk RNA-seq data.
